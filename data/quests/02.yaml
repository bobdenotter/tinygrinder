title: The Missing Heirloom
introduction: The adventurer has been hired by a wealthy merchant to retrieve a valuable family heirloom that has been stolen. The thief was last seen heading towards a nearby abandoned mine. The merchant is offering a reward of 200 gold pieces for its safe return.
travel: The mine is a few hours’ journey from the town. The adventurer can travel on foot or hire a horse to get there quicker. The mine entrance is hidden, so the adventurer will need to navigate through the forest to find it.
location: The mine is infested with goblins who have set up a small camp inside. The goblins have the heirloom, but they won’t give it up without a fight. The adventurer will need to defeat the goblin guards to gain access to the heirloom.
wrap-up: Once the heirloom is retrieved, the adventurer can return it to the merchant for the reward. The merchant is grateful and may offer additional work in the future.
